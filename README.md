# prescriptive-monitoring-PhD-thesis

This repository contains supplementary material for the PhD thesis titled `Prescriptive Process Monitoring Under Uncertainty and Resource Constraints` by [Mahmoud Shoush](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jw4rBlkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Marlon Dumas](https://kodu.ut.ee/~dumas/). The thesis explores methods to develop prescriptive process monitoring (PrPM) approaches that effectively handle uncertainty and resource limitations.

## Gaps
The research identifies two significant gaps in the existing literature:
* **Resource Assumptions:** Current approaches often presume that interventions can be immediately triggered for all process cases without resource limitations, such as the availability of personnel to execute tasks (e.g., contacting a customer to offer a discount).
* **Uncertainty Neglect:** Many approaches rely exclusively on predictive monitoring outputs, disregarding the inherent uncertainty in these predictions, which can lead to suboptimal decisions and outcomes.

## Proposal
* To address these challenges, the thesis introduces `Uncertainty-Aware Prescriptive Process Monitoring (UN-PrPM)` by combining predictive models with methods to quantify and incorporate prediction uncertainty.
* Additionally, it categorizes prior work into two main streams:
  * `White-Box PrPM (WB-PrPM):` Approaches where decision rules and thresholds are manually defined by analysts.
  * `Black-Box PrPM (BB-PrPM):` Data-driven methods that automatically learn intervention policies from historical data.
 
    
This work advances PrPM by tackling uncertainty and resource constraints across both of these streams.
